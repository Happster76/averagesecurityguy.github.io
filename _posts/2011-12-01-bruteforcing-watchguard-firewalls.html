<p>In a recent pentest I ran across the web interface for a Watchguard firewall and wanted to bruteforce the password. I couldn't find a tool to do the brute force so I wrote one. I ran the script against the firewall and received valid responses to my queries but I never guessed the correct password because I didn't receive the positive response I was expecting. I guess I should have tested the script on a firewall to which I knew the password but I didn't have one around at the time. If any of you would like to test this script for me I would greatly appreciate it. You can find the script <a href="https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/scripts/blob/master/firewarebf.py" title="fireware brute force python script">here</a>.</p>
