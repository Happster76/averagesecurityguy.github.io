<p>For centuries people learned a trade by becoming an apprentice to a master craftsman. After spending a number of years, typically seven, working under the master they became a journeyman and were able to start their own business. A journeyman was able to become a master only after presenting a "master piece" to his respective guild. Once you became a master, then you were allowed to take on an apprentice and start the process over. If we look at information security as a hands on craft, what would you learn as an apprentice on your way to becoming a journeyman? What would a "master piece" look like?</p>
<p>I think an apprenticeship program would look something like this:</p>
<h4>Years 1 and 2 - Networking and System Administration</h4>
<ul>
<li>Gain a thorough understanding of common network protocols like TCP/IP, Ethernet, ARP, UDP, and ICMP.</li>
<li>Gain a thorough understanding of DNS, DHCP, Active Directory, SMTP, FTP, and other common network services.</li>
<li>Gain ability to perform administrative tasks on both Windows and Linux machines.</li>
<li>Learn to automate common administrative tasks using scripting languages such as bash, perl, python, ruby, vb, and powershell.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Years 3 and 4 - Risk Assessment and Disaster Planning</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand the common risks to which your network and systems are exposed.</li>
<li>Understand how to mitigate those risks.</li>
<li>Understand how to build redundancy into your network and systems so that a single failure does not take down the entire system.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Years 5 and 6 - Vulnerability Assessment and Exploitation</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand common network and system vulnerabilities and how to fix them.</li>
<li>Understand methods, both automated and manual, of finding vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Understand methods, both automated and manual, of exploiting vulnerabilities.</li>
<li>Understand methods for preventing vulnerabilities in networks, systems and code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Year 7 - Communication</h4>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to effectively communicate in written form (ie. documentation and reporting).</li>
<li>Understand how to effectively communicate in verbal form (ie. presentations, meetings).</li>
<li>Understand the different "languages" of your audience (ie. IT department, CIO, CEO).</li>
</ul>
<p>I know there are a lot of details missing from this outline, especially if we are thinking about this as a hands on craft, but I think it is a good place to start. I would like to know what you would add to this outline, particularly what hands on activities would you place under each category. I have a shared Google document <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ISvD16-n99Ieaen691qF0sxv_ATnfAMXUIrfcWlj6X4/edit">here</a> that you can update with your thoughts. I will leave the document open unless people abuse it.</p>
