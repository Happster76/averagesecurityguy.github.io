<p>This weekend we had a technology meetup at the <a href="http://4thfloor.chattlibrary.org/" title="Chattanooga Library 4thfloor">4thfloor</a> in the downtown branch of the Chattanooga Library. We had a good turn out and I was able to talk about two of my favorite subjects, Python and infosec.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/presentations/blob/master/python_requests.pdf">presentation</a> I gave on the Requests library for Python. </p>
