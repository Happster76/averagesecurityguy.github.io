<p>A few years back I created a simple Ruby script that would read a firewall configuration and create a list of ACL tables. This was part of a larger project used to automate the writing of audit reports. Eventually, I decided to make this a standalone script that would read configuration files from multiple firewalls and produce a nice HTML report, which includes a list of vulnerabilities as well as an overview of the configuration. I am proud to say that Prometheus is finally ready.</p>
<p>Prometheus is intended help system administrators, auditors, and information security consultants easily review firewall configuration files to identify vulnerabilities in the access control entries (rules). Prometheus also checks for vulnerabilities in the remote administration configuration. Eventually, Prometheus will parse more firewalls, check for more vulnerabilities, and will provide an overview of larger portions of the firewall configuration.</p>
<p>If you would like to check out Prometheus you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/prometheus" title="Prometheus firewall analyzer">https://github.com/averagesecurityguy/prometheus</a>.</p>
