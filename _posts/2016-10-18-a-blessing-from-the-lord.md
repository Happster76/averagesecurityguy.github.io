title: A Blessing From The Lord
---
This is not my typical post but it's something that needs to be said.

It is not an exaggeration to say that I wouldn't be the man I am today if it were not for my wife. For 16 years my wife has patiently and lovingly knocked off my rough edges. Sometimes, all it took was a gentle elbow to the ribs and other times it took a constant knock to the backside of my head (sometimes literally.) When she met me, I was a lonesome and lonely person who didn't like people. I was generally to busy to be bothered by others, was impatient with other people's mistakes, and was constantly putting my foot in my mouth. Over the years, she has helped me to become much kinder, more patient, and gentler with my words. I still don't like people, but there are a number of persons I like because she has pushed me to make friends and to be sympathetic to others.

Why am I telling you all this? Because I love my wife and I want everyone to know it, especially her. My blog and Twitter are the largest public platform I have so I'm going to use them to shout, "GAIL, I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU KNOW." I don't deserve a wife who is so patient, loving, faithful, and kind but that is what I have and she truly is a blessing from the Lord. I can honestly say that I know what Love is because of her.

I love you Gail and I hope that I can always be the man you believe I am.
