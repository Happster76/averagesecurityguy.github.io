<p>In August of this year my career took an unexpected turn. I have been working the last few years to become a penetration tester. I earned my GPEN and OSCP certifications in the pursuit of that goal and I took a job with Sword &amp; Shield so I could do penetration testing full time. My career as a pentester was humming along fine when out of nowhere I was offered a job doing API programming for Tenable Security. My first love has always been programming and throughout my career I have found my greatest satisfaction in programming. So, when this opportunity came along I was ecstatic. Although I was enthusiastic about the opportunity, I was also sad to leave behind penetration testing, which I now know is my second love.</p>
<p>I look forward to the new adventures that await me at Tenable Security but also plan to continue doing some penetration testing on the side to keep my skills. I am also hoping to do some vulnerability research and maybe even develop my first 0-day sometime in the next year. I'm not sure what will happen but tune in here and I will keep you posted. </p>
