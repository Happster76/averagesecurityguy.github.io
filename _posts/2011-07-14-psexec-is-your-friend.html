<h3>Obtaining Domain Admin Access Using Psexec</h3>
<p>On a recent pentest, one of the goals was to gain domain admin access to the network. If you can compromise a domain controller you can use the commands <code>net user username password /ADD /DOMAIN</code> and <code>net group "Domain Admins" username /ADD /DOMAIN</code>. I found the domain controllers but was unable to identify a suitable vulnerability that would allow me to access them. However, I found another box on the domain that was vulnerable to MS08-067 (yes, there are still boxes that have not been patched for this vulnerability). Using metasploit I was able to get a meterpreter shell on this box. I then used the ps command to find out what processes were running. I found a few processes running under the administrator account for the domain. Next, I migrated to one of the processes and used the upload command in meterpreter to upload psexec to the box. Meterpreter uploads files to the default path for the user. Next, I used the shell command to drop into a shell and ran the commands <code> psexec \\nameofdc net user username password /ADD /DOMAIN</code> and <code>psexec \\nameofdc net group "Domain Admins" username /ADD /DOMAIN</code>. I now had my own user account with domain admin credentials.</p>
<h3>A Few Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are using BT5 you can find psexec in the <code>/pentest/windows-binaries/pstools</code> folder.</li>
<li>You can run the <code>net user</code> and <code>net group</code> commands from any process running under any domain admin account. To identify the domain admins you can use the enum_domain_group_users post module. You need to background your meterpreter session and type <code>use post/windows/gather/enum_domain_group_users</code>. Then set the group name, <code>set GROUP "Domain Admins"</code>, and session <code>set SESSION 1</code>. Then run it. You will get a list of domain admin users.</li>
<li>If you try to drop to a shell and get an error like this <code>stdapi_sys_process_execute: Operation failed: 1314</code>, do this instead <code>execute -f cmd.exe -c -i -H</code>. This is a <a href="http://dev.metasploit.com/redmine/issues/1448">known issue</a> in meterpreter.</li>
</ul>
