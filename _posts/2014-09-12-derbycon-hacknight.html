<h3>***Update***</h3>
<p>We will be meeting in the main lobby of the Hyatt. The Friday night after party starts at 9:00 so I expect there will be plenty of room in the lobby. If not we can break into smaller groups and split up.</p>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>This is an opportunity for developers and wannabe developers to talk about projects and write some code. If you want to discuss your latest idea, need help with a current project, or want to learn how to program, this is the place for you.</p>
<h3>When</h3>
<p>Friday night, September 26th from 9:00PM - Until</p>
<h3>What should I bring?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A laptop with a text editor and a compiler/parser for the language of your choice</li>
<li>Ideas for a project or a desire to help on an existing project.</li>
<li>Desire to write code (No one is going to write it for you.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where</h3>
<p>TBD - Keep an eye on my Twitter account (<a title="AverageSecGuy Twitter Account" href="https://twitter.com/averagesecguy">@averagesecguy</a>)</p>
<h3>What language are you coding in?</h3>
<p>I primarily write in Python but can help out with Ruby and PHP. Depending on who else shows up, PowerShell, Ruby, Python, PHP, and C/C++/C# should be well represented.</p>
