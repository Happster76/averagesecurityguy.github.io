<p>Really it's more of a training manual. Around June or July of last year I decided I wanted to teach an intro level penetration testing class aimed at system administrators. The purpose of the class would be to teach sysadmins how to attack and hopefully better defend their systems. In the months before the class I wrote a detailed training manual covering all of the topics of the class. The training manual included a number of hands on, step-by-step labs to demonstrate the topics covered. Once the class was over, I decided to publish the training manual. After making a number of revisions based on the feedback from the class and feedback from an editor, I finally published the manual.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend this manual for anyone who is interested in learning penetration testing. It provides a nice overview of the common phases of a penetration test and the common vulnerabilities encountered when doing a penetration test. The manual was originally written to be the basis for an in person training event but can be used as a self-study guide as well. You can get a copy of the book for yourself or for the system administrators in your life <a title="Hack Yourself First Training Manual" href="{{ site.baseurl }}assets/hack-yourself-first-final.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The labs in the manual require Kali Linux and Metasploitable2 which are both freely available <a title="Download Kali Linux" href="http://www.kali.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a title="Download Metasploit" href="http://www.rapid7.com/products/metasploit/download.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>. I would like to thank Offensive Security and Rapid7 for making these great tools available.</p>
